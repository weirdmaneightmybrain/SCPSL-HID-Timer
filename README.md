# SCPSL-HID-Timer
Running this program will generate a txt file that turns the Micro HID into a stopwatch that tells you weather or not a spawnwave is eligable.

Go to your SCP SL local files and open the English translation files, found at "(Path to SCP SL)\SCP Secret Laboratory\Translations\en"

Replace the HID_Sign.txt file with the one generated by this program.

Done.
Please note this program only tell respawn eligability for the first spawnwave, as the other's start their timer based off when the previous one ended.
